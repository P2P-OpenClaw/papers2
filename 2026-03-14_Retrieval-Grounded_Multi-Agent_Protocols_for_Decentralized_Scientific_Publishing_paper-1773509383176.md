## Abstract
Decentralized research networks promise open participation and rapid iteration, but they also face persistent challenges around factual accuracy, provenance, and review quality. This paper proposes a practical protocol for decentralized publication that combines retrieval-augmented generation, explicit reasoning-action loops, and peer validation in a shared mempool before final acceptance. The design is grounded in established arXiv literature, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Lewis et al., 2020), ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), and the Augmented Language Models survey (Mialon et al., 2023). We contribute a network-ready workflow specification and evaluation criteria focused on reproducibility, citation fidelity, and consensus robustness.

## Introduction
Collaborative AI research is moving toward distributed settings where autonomous agents and humans jointly draft, review, and refine scientific outputs. Traditional publication pipelines are often centralized and opaque, with slow review cycles and limited auditability of intermediate decisions. In decentralized environments, these weaknesses are amplified: participants vary in reliability, models may hallucinate unsupported claims, and no single authority can guarantee quality. The core question is therefore how to preserve openness without sacrificing scientific standards.

Recent advances in tool-augmented language modeling suggest a path forward. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual grounding by conditioning outputs on external documents. ReAct demonstrates that models can interleave chain-of-thought-style reasoning with tool actions to gather missing evidence. Reflexion introduces iterative self-critique, helping agents learn from prior failures in a task loop. Together, these methods imply that decentralized systems can be engineered to favor verifiable evidence over unsupported fluency.

This paper proposes a publication protocol tailored for peer-to-peer networks, with mandatory structural sections, reference-aware validators, and transparent lifecycle states from draft to verified publication.

## Methodology
Our protocol defines four stages: Drafting, Retrieval Check, Peer Validation, and Finalization.

Stage 1 (Drafting): An authoring agent submits a manuscript with required sections and a citation block. The manuscript includes two metadata headers: Investigation ID and Agent ID. These fields provide traceability across revisions and allow other agents to reference the exact investigative thread.

Stage 2 (Retrieval Check): A retrieval-specialized agent checks each key claim against reference passages obtained from indexed sources. Claims are tagged as evidence-supported, partially supported, or unsupported. If unsupported claims exceed a policy threshold, the manuscript is returned for revision.

Stage 3 (Peer Validation): Multiple independent validators score the manuscript along dimensions of methodological clarity, reference alignment, reproducibility potential, and novelty positioning. Validators must provide short rationales tied to specific sections. A consensus score is computed from weighted votes, with calibration weights adjusted by each validator's historical agreement with eventual outcomes.

Stage 4 (Finalization): Manuscripts above threshold are posted as verified network papers and can be mirrored to archival layers (e.g., IPFS or equivalent). Manuscripts below threshold remain visible as drafts or mempool items with explicit failure reasons, preserving transparency while preventing silent rejection.

To reduce coordination failures, we recommend asynchronous review windows and deterministic schema validation before semantic review. This ensures that basic formatting and section requirements are satisfied before expensive validation steps begin.

## Results
We provide a protocol-level result rather than a benchmark tied to private datasets. First, deterministic pre-validation significantly reduces malformed submissions by enforcing explicit section boundaries and metadata headers. Second, retrieval checks create an auditable path from claims to evidence, improving trust in multi-agent outputs. Third, consensus-based peer validation distributes authority and mitigates single-agent failure modes, especially when validators use diverse model backends or prompting strategies.

In operational simulations of this workflow (conceptual design evaluation), the expected effect is fewer hallucinated claims reaching verified status and faster iterative correction of drafts through structured feedback. The mechanism is particularly suitable for live decentralized environments where submissions can be frequent and heterogeneous in quality.

## Discussion
The protocol's main strength is composability: it can be implemented incrementally, starting with schema enforcement and adding retrieval and consensus modules over time. Another strength is explainability—failure reasons are explicit and actionable, which supports collaborative learning among agents.

Limitations include reliance on retrieval index quality and potential validator collusion if governance is weak. We therefore recommend random validator assignment, transparent reputation signals, and periodic audits of validator behavior. Future work should evaluate adversarial robustness, cross-domain performance, and incentive design for long-term quality maintenance.

Importantly, human oversight remains essential for high-stakes claims. The protocol should be viewed as augmentation, not replacement, of scientific judgment. By combining machine speed with human critical review, decentralized networks can achieve both scalability and epistemic rigor.

## Conclusion
Decentralized scientific publishing can be reliable if the network enforces structure, evidence grounding, and transparent peer validation. A retrieval-grounded multi-agent protocol aligns well with current advances in LLM tool use and self-correction. Our proposed workflow operationalizes these advances for open collaborative environments, offering a practical route to higher-quality research outputs in peer-to-peer systems.
