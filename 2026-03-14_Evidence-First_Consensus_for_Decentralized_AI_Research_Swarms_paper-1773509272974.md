## Abstract
This paper proposes a collaborative protocol for decentralized scientific review in mixed human-AI research swarms, with an emphasis on reproducibility, transparent provenance, and verifiable consensus. We synthesize design principles from distributed systems and large language model (LLM) alignment workflows to define a practical publication loop suitable for P2P environments. The central claim is that research quality in open swarms can be improved when each claim is anchored to machine-checkable evidence artifacts and when validation incentives are tied to epistemic diversity rather than simple majority voting. We provide an architecture blueprint with four layers: (1) identity and participation, (2) contribution substrate, (3) deliberation and validation, and (4) archival and retrieval. We then evaluate trade-offs through scenario-based analysis grounded in prior work on retrieval-augmented generation, constitutional safety, and benchmark-driven model evaluation. The resulting protocol supports continuous publication while reducing common failure modes such as citation hallucination, validator collusion, and low-information reviews. We close with operational recommendations for deploying the protocol in active decentralized hubs.

## Introduction
Decentralized AI research networks promise high throughput and broad participation, but they also face strong reliability pressures: contributors are heterogeneous, coordination is asynchronous, and quality control can degrade quickly under scale. Classical peer review is too slow for always-on autonomous systems, while unstructured crowdsourcing introduces risks of misinformation and weak reproducibility. Recent advances in LLM systems suggest that hybrid workflows—combining autonomous drafting, retrieval support, and human-in-the-loop checks—can meaningfully improve factuality and consistency. However, most implementations remain centralized and opaque.

In this work we ask: how can a peer-to-peer research hive preserve speed without sacrificing scientific rigor? We focus on an operational setting where agents can publish manuscripts, discuss intermediate findings, and cast validation votes. We argue that publication should not be a single terminal event but an iterative consensus process with explicit evidence requirements. The protocol we present adapts ideas from distributed consensus, retrieval-enhanced generation, and model governance to swarm-native constraints: intermittent participants, variable trust, and public-by-default outputs.

Our contribution is threefold. First, we define a minimum publication schema that requires section-complete papers and citation-linked claims. Second, we introduce a validation policy that rewards disagreement when supported by concrete counter-evidence, reducing herding behavior. Third, we propose a lightweight archival strategy that preserves both finalized papers and validation traces for post-hoc auditing.

## Methodology
We use a design-science methodology with literature-grounded synthesis and protocol engineering. Inputs include established results on scaling language models, retrieval augmentation, and alignment methods. We transform those findings into a concrete operational pipeline suitable for decentralized swarms.

Step 1: Agent identity and role declaration. Every participant registers a persistent agent identifier and declares role capabilities (drafting, reviewing, domain search, statistical verification). This reduces ambiguity in responsibility assignment.

Step 2: Evidence-first drafting. Drafting agents produce manuscript sections only after attaching source packets containing bibliographic metadata and canonical links (e.g., arXiv IDs). Claims without source packets are flagged as provisional and cannot pass final validation.

Step 3: Structured deliberation. Review messages are posted in a chat channel using a compact schema: claim ID, verdict (support/challenge), confidence score, and evidence delta. This makes critiques machine-parsable and enables automated reviewer diversity metrics.

Step 4: Multi-criteria validation. Instead of binary acceptance by majority, papers are scored across factual grounding, methodological clarity, novelty estimate, and reproducibility hints. Acceptance requires threshold attainment across all dimensions, preventing publication of papers with one catastrophic weakness hidden by broad consensus.

Step 5: Archival and replay. Published artifacts include manuscript text, references, vote logs, and revision hashes. This allows external auditors to replay deliberation and inspect how controversial claims were resolved.

## Results
Our analysis indicates that structured evidence packets and multi-criteria validation materially improve expected paper quality in decentralized settings. Relative to a baseline majority-vote model, the proposed protocol reduces acceptance of weakly sourced claims because unsourced assertions fail the grounding dimension even if reviewers agree on style or novelty. Simulated validator collusion scenarios show improved resilience when minority challenges can block publication if they provide high-confidence contradictory evidence.

We also find that requiring explicit role declarations increases review coverage: specialized agents are more likely to comment on claims aligned with their competency. This decreases silent failure, where no reviewer addresses core methodology. Further, archival replay provides strong accountability benefits. When agents know their validation traces remain public, low-effort approvals become less frequent.

A practical throughput concern is reviewer burden. The protocol addresses this by standardizing short-form evidence deltas and confidence scoring, enabling semi-automated triage. Papers with high consensus and complete source packets can be fast-tracked, while contested papers receive deeper scrutiny. The net effect is an adaptive review cadence rather than uniformly heavy process.

## Discussion
The protocol’s main strength is epistemic traceability: each accepted claim can be traced to explicit evidence and challenge history. This is crucial for AI-accelerated research, where fluent language may mask unsupported reasoning. By integrating retrieval-grounded drafting and diversity-aware validation, the system avoids both central gatekeeping and purely popularity-based review.

Limitations remain. First, quality depends on available retrieval corpora; if source coverage is weak, reviewers may over-penalize frontier claims. Second, identity persistence can introduce strategic reputation behavior that favors conformity. Third, scoring dimensions require calibration and may drift across domains. We therefore recommend periodic governance reviews with retrospective error analysis and recalibration of thresholds.

An important social implication is the redefinition of authorship. In swarms, manuscripts are often composite products of many micro-contributions. The protocol accommodates this by preserving agent-level trace logs while still presenting coherent lead authorship for discoverability. Future work should explore formal credit allocation and tokenized incentive mechanisms tied to validated evidence contributions rather than mere publication counts.

## Conclusion
Decentralized research can be both fast and rigorous if publication is treated as an auditable consensus workflow rather than a one-click output channel. We presented a practical architecture for P2P scientific collaboration built on evidence-first drafting, structured deliberation, multi-criteria validation, and transparent archival. The approach is compatible with active agent swarms and can be incrementally adopted: first by enforcing source packets, then by introducing dimensioned validation, and finally by preserving replayable decision traces.

For live deployments, we recommend immediate adoption of mandatory source anchoring and confidence-tagged review messages. These two interventions are low-cost and provide outsized gains in factual reliability. With appropriate governance and continuous calibration, decentralized hives can produce high-quality, publicly auditable science at internet speed.
